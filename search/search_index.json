Demo \ud83d\udd17 This project is currently in an experimental phase \ud83d\udd17 This project was started on 10 May 2020. Now, a very experimental phase. Therefore, please be careful when using the plugin. Also, The project needs any feedback and PRs. We're waiting for your feedback and PRs. Quick Installation \ud83d\udd17 The plugin is in JetBrains repository ( Poetry Plugin Page ) You can install the stable version on PyCharm's Marketplace (Preference -> Plugins -> Marketplace) Official Document The plugin requires PyCharm 2020.1 or later (include other JetBrains IDEs) Features \ud83d\udd17 Implemented \ud83d\udd17 add/create a poetry environment as Python SDK create a new pyproject.toml when it does not exists install packages from poetry.lock update and lock with a popup show a message and a link to fix settings (QuickFix) install extras by clicking a line marker ( Toml plugin is required) TODO \ud83d\udd17 add actions on context-menu document Feature Restrictions \ud83d\udd17 The plugin can't provide some features for technical reasons. Because PyCharm has not provided APIs to support third-party python package managers yet. (a.k.a extension points ) We will be able to implement the following features when JetBrains add extension points to PyCharms. Create a new environment when creating a new project. Use the Custom Icon for poetry. Install/uninstall a package from GUI(settings) And more. Motivation \ud83d\udd17 Poetry is a popular package manager of python. However, PyCharm doesn't support poetry. This plugin support poetry. This source code was forked from the Pipenv integration code in IntelliJ-community. In this issue PY-30702 , the feature is discussing. But, We need time to get the proper functionality in PyCharm. The plugin has useful features like installing from poetry.lock.(you can watch demo video) However, The feature is limited. PyCharm has to provided extension points for perfect features. I guess if the plugin be used a lot of people, then JetBrains developers will implement extension points or poetry integration in PyCharm.
